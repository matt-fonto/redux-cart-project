# React/Redux Cart Project
A functional cart created with React/Redux. The idea of the project was to put in practice different Redux concepts, such as:
- store 
- actions
- reducers 
- createAsyncThunk
- extraReducers

# Project Description
The app fetches the data from the API through createAsyncThunk. The user is able to:
1. increase/decrease the quantity of any item
2. clear the cart -- a modal will appear asking the user to confirm the action

Meanwhile, the app calculates the totals and displays it to the user.

# Technologies used
